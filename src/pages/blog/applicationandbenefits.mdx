Making transactions faster:  Once a condition mentioned in smart contract is met, the contracts associated are executed immediately. No time spent on manual processes like documentations and paperwork.

No need of third party: All the data of transaction is stored on a shared ledger in encrypted format. This also removes the possibility of altering information for personal benefit.

Secured Transactions: Blockchain transaction records are encrypted, which makes them very hard to hack. Moreover, because each record is connected to the previous and subsequent records on a distributed ledger, hackers would have to alter the entire chain to change a single record, which is nearly impossible.
